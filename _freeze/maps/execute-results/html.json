Now we are going to look at how to create maps. \n\nMost of the work that we perform as environmental/biological scientists involves going out to a location and sampling information there. Sometimes only once, and sometimes over a period of time. All of these different sampling methods lend themselves to different types of figures. One of those, collection of data at different points, is best shown with maps. As we will see over the course of Day 3, creating maps in **`ggplot2`** is very straight forward and is extensively supported. For that reason we are going to have plenty of time to also learn how to do some more advanced things. Our goal in this chapter is to produce the figure below.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n\nBefore we begin let's go ahead and load the packages we will need, as well as the several dataframes required to make the final product.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpubr)\n\n# Load data\nload(\"data/south_africa_coast.RData\")\nload(\"data/sa_provinces.RData\")\nload(\"data/rast_annual.RData\")\nload(\"data/MUR.RData\")\nload(\"data/MUR_low_res.RData\")\n\n# Choose which SST product you would like to use\nsst <- MUR_low_res\n# OR\nsst <- MUR\n\n# The colour pallette we will use for ocean temperature\ncols11 <- c(\"#004dcd\", \"#0068db\", \"#007ddb\", \"#008dcf\", \"#009bbc\",\n            \"#00a7a9\", \"#1bb298\", \"#6cba8f\", \"#9ac290\", \"#bec99a\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## A new concept?\n\nThe idea of creating a map in R may be daunting to some, but remember that a basic map is nothing more than a simple figure with an x and y axis. We tend to think of maps as different from other scientific figures, whereas in reality they are created the exact same way. Let's compare a dot plot of the chicken weight data against a dot plot of the coastline of South Africa.\n\nChicken dots:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\nSouth African coast dots:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n:::\n\n\nDoes that look familiar? Notice how the x and y axis tick labels look the same as any map you would see in an atlas. This is because they are. But this isn't a great way to create a map. Rather it is better to represent the land mass with a polygon. With **`ggplot2`** this is a simple task.\n\n## Land mask\n\nNow that we have seen that a map is nothing more than a bunch of dots and shapes on specific points along the x and y axes we are going to look at the steps we would take to build a more complex map. Don't worry if this seems daunting at first. We are going to take this step by step and ensure that each step is made clear along the way. The first step is to create a polygon. Note that we create an aesthetic argument inside of `geom_polygon()` and not `ggplot()` because some of the steps we will take later on will not accept the `group` aesthetic. Remember, whatever aesthetic arguments we put inside of `ggplot()` will be inserted for us into all of our other `geom_...()` lines of code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) # The land mask\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Borders\n\nThe first thing we will add is the province borders as seen in Figure \\@ref(fig:map-goal). Notice how we only add one more line of code to do this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) # The province borders\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Force lon/lat extent\n\nUnfortunately when we added our borders it increased the plotting area of our map past what we would like. To correct that we will need to explicitly state the borders we want.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) + \n  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0) # Force lon/lat extent\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Ocean temperature\n\nThis is starting to look pretty fancy, but it would be nicer if there was some colour involved. So let's add the ocean temperature. Again, this will only require one more line of code. Starting to see a pattern? But what is different this time and why?\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) + # The ocean temperatures\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +\n  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat looks... odd. Why do the colours look like someone melted a big bucket of ice cream in the ocean? This is because the colours you see in this figure are the default colours for discrete values in **`ggplot2`**. If we want to change them we may do so easily by adding yet one more line of code.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Temp. (°C)\", values = cols11) + # Set the colour palette\n  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere's a colour palette that would make Jacques Cousteau swoon. When we set the colour palette for a figure in **`ggplot2`** we must use that colour palette for all other instances of those types of values, too. What this means is that any other discrete values that will be filled in, like the ocean colour above, must use the same colour palette (there are some technical exceptions to this rule that we will not cover in this course). We normally want **`ggplot2`** to use consistent colour palettes anyway, but it is important to note that this constraint exists. Let's see what we mean. Next we will add the coastal pixels to our figure with one more line of code. We won't change anything else. Note how **`ggplot2`** changes the colour of the coastal pixels to match the ocean colour automatically.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_tile(data = rast_annual, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = bins), \n            colour = \"white\", size = 0.1) + # The coastal temperature values\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Temp. (°C)\", values = cols11) +\n  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Final touches\n\nWe used `geom_tile()` instead of `geom_rast()` to add the coastal pixels above so that we could add those little white boxes around them. This figure is looking pretty great now. And it only took a few rows of code to put it all together! The last step is to add several more lines of code that will control for all of the little things we want to change about the appearance of the figure. Each little thing that is changed below is annotated for your convenience.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfinal_map <- ggplot(data = south_africa_coast, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n  geom_raster(data = sst, aes(fill = bins)) +\n  geom_polygon(colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey70\", aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_path(data = sa_provinces, aes(group = group)) +\n  geom_tile(data = rast_annual, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fill = bins), \n            colour = \"white\", size = 0.1) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\"Temp. (°C)\", values = cols11) +\n  coord_equal(xlim = c(15, 34), ylim = c(-36, -26), expand = 0) +\n  scale_x_continuous(position = \"top\") + # Put x axis labels on top of figure\n  theme(axis.title = element_blank(), # Remove the axis labels\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 7), # Change text size in legend\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 7), # Change legend title text size\n        legend.key.height = unit(0.3, \"cm\"), # Change size of legend\n        legend.background = element_rect(colour = \"white\"), # Add legend background\n        legend.justification = c(1, 0), # Change position of legend\n        legend.position = c(0.55, 0.4) # Fine tune position of legend\n        )\nfinal_map\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat is a very clean looking map so let's go ahead and save it on our computers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(plot = final_map, \"figures/map_complete.pdf\", height = 6, width = 9)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we have learned the basics of creating a beautiful map in **`ggplot2`** it is time to look at some of the more particular things we will need to make our maps extra stylish. There are also a few more things we need to learn how to do before our maps can be truly publication quality.\n\nIf we have not yet loaded the **`tidyverse`** let's do so.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(ggsn)\n\n# Load Africa map\nload(\"data/africa_map.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Default maps\n\nIn order to access the default maps included with the **`tidyverse`** we will use the function `borders()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot() +\n  borders() + # The global shape file\n  coord_equal() # Equal sizing for lon/lat \n```\n:::\n\n\nJikes! It's as simple as that to load a map of the whole planet. Usually we are not going to want to make a map of the entire planet, so let's see how to focus on just the area around South Africa. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsa_1 <- ggplot() +\n  borders(fill = \"grey70\", colour = \"black\") +\n  coord_equal(xlim = c(12, 36), ylim = c(-38, -22), expand = 0) # Force lon/lat extent\nsa_1\n```\n:::\n\n\nThat is a very tidy looking map of South(ern) Africa without needing to load any files.\n\n## Specific labels\n\nA map is almost always going to need some labels and other visual cues. We saw in the previous section how to add site labels. The following code chunk shows how this differs if we want to add just one label at a time. This can be useful if each label needs to be different from all other labels for whatever reason. We may also see that the text labels we are creating have `\\n` in them. When R sees these two characters together like this it reads this as an instruction to return down a line. Let's run the code to make sure we see what this means.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsa_2 <- sa_1 +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"Atlantic\\nOcean\", \n           x = 15.1, y = -32.0, \n           size = 5.0, \n           angle = 30, \n           colour = \"navy\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", label = \"Indian\\nOcean\", \n           x = 33.2, y = -34.2, \n           size = 5.0, \n           angle = 330, \n           colour = \"springgreen\")\nsa_2\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Scale bars\n\nWith our fancy labels added, let's insert a scale bar next. There is no default scale bar function in the **`tidyverse`**, which is why we have loaded the **`ggsn`** package. This package is devoted to adding scale bars and North arrows to **`ggplot2`** figures. There are heaps of options so we'll just focus on one of them for now. It is a bit finicky so to get it looking exactly how we want it requires some guessing and checking. Please feel free to play around with the coordinates below. We may see the list of available North arrow shapes by running `northSymbols()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsa_3 <- sa_2 +\n  scalebar(x.min = 22, x.max = 26, y.min = -36, y.max = -35, # Set location of bar\n           dist = 200, height = 1, st.dist = 0.8, st.size = 4, # Set particulars\n           dd2km = TRUE, model = \"WGS84\") + # Set appearance\n  north(x.min = 22.5, x.max = 25.5, y.min = -33, y.max = -31, # Set location of symbol\n        scale = 1.2, symbol = 16)\nsa_3\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Insetting\n\nIn order to inset a smaller map inside of a larger map we must first create the smaller map. We have already loaded just such a map of Africa so we will use that for this example.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nafrica_map\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd now to inset this map of Africa into our map of southern Africa we will need to learn how to create a 'grob'. This is very simple and does not require any extra work on our part. Remember that **`ggplot2`** objects are different from normal objects (i.e. dataframes), and that they have their own way of storing and accessing data. In order to convert any sort of thing into a format that ggplot understands we convert it into a grob, as shown below. Once converted, we may then plop it onto our figure/map wherever we please. Both of these steps are accomplished with the single function `annotation_custom()`. This is also a good way to add logos or any other sort of image to a map/figure. You can really go completely bananas. It's even possible to add GIFs. Such happy. Much excite. Very wonderment.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsa_4 <- sa_3 +\n  annotation_custom(grob = ggplotGrob(africa_map),\n                    xmin = 20.9, xmax = 26.9,\n                    ymin = -30, ymax = -24)\nsa_4\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Rounding it out\n\nThere are a lot of exciting things going on in our figure now. To round out our adventures in mapping let's tweak the lon/lat labels to a more prestigious convention. There are two ways to do this. One of which requires us to install the **`scales`** package. Don't worry, it's a small one!\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsa_final <- sa_4 +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(16, 32, 4),\n                     labels = c(\"16°E\", \"20°E\", \"24°E\", \"28°E\", \"32°E\"),\n                     position = \"bottom\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-36, -24, 4),\n                     labels = c(\"36.0°S\", \"32.0°S\", \"28.0°S\", \"24.0°S\"),\n                     position = \"right\") +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\nsa_final\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd lastly we save the fruits of our labours.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggsave(plot = sa_final, filename = \"figures/southern_africa_final.pdf\", \n       height = 6, width = 8)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we've seen how to produce complex maps with **`ggplot2`** we are going to learn how to bring Google maps into the mix. Some kind hearted person has made a package for R that allows us to do this relatively easily. But that means we will need to install another new package.\n\nAfter we learn how to use Google maps we will take some time to learn additional mapping techniques that we may want for creating publication quality figures.\n\n## **`ggmap`**\n\nThe package we will need for this tut is **`ggmap`**. It is a bit beefy so let's get started on installing it now. Once it's done we will activated the packages we need and load some site points for mapping.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggmap)\n\n# Load data\nload(\"data/cape_point_sites.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nTake a moment to look at the data we loaded. What does it show?\n\n## Mapping Cape Point\n\nWe will be creating our Google map in two steps. The first step is to use the `get_map()` function to tell Google what area of the world we want a map of, as well as what sort of map we want. Remember how Google maps can be switched from satellite view to map view? We may do that in R as well. For now we are only going to use the satellite view so that we may insert out own labels. But if we look in the help file we may see a description of all the different map types available. There are a bunch!\n\nThe `get_map()` function relies on a healthy Internet connection to run. The downloading of Google maps can be a tenuous process without a stable connection. For that reason, if your Internet connection is not great you may run the commented out line of code in favour of loading the Google map. This is a pre-saved file of the output of the code chunk below. Please rather run the `get_map()` function first, and if it won't connect only then load the saved file as shown below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncape_point <- get_map(location = c(lon = 18.36519, lat = -34.2352581),\n                        zoom = 10, maptype = 'satellite')\n# load(\"data/cape_point.RData\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nIf we look in the environment panel in the top right corner, what do we see? What do we think the code above is doing?\n\nThe second step in the process is to treat the Google data we downloaded as though it is just any ordinary **`ggplot2`** object. The same as the ones we created yesterday and today. For this reason we may use `+` to add new lines of **`ggplot2`** code to the Google object we downloaded in order to show site locations etc. Let's first just see how the map looks when we add some points. Note that we do not use the function `ggplot()` at the beginning of our code, but rather `ggmap()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncp_1 <- ggmap(cape_point) +\n  geom_point(data = cape_point_sites, aes(x = lon+0.002, y = lat-0.007), \n             colour = \"red\", size =  2.5) +\n  labs(x = \"\", y = \"\")\ncp_1\n```\n:::\n\n\nPretty cool huh?! You may do this for anywhere in the world just as easy as this. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that the lon/lat coordinates for Google appear to be slightly different than the global standard. This is why the x and y `aes()` values in the code above have a little bit added or subtracted from them. That one small issue aside, this is a  nice quick workflow for adding your site locations to a Google map background. Play around with the different map types you can download and try it for any place you can think of.\n\n## Site labels\n\nThe previous figure shows our sites along Cape Point, which is great, but which site is which?! We need site labels. This is a relatively straightforward process, so we've given a complicated example of how to do so here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncp_2 <- cp_1 +\n  geom_text(data = cape_point_sites, # Choose dataframe\n            aes(lon+0.002, lat-0.007, label = site), # Set aesthetics\n            hjust = 1.15, vjust = 0.5, # Adjust vertical and horizontal\n            size = 3, colour = \"white\") # Adjust appearance\ncp_2\n```\n:::\n\n\n## DIY maps\n\nNow that we have learned how to make conventional maps, as well as fancy Google maps, it is time for us to branch out once again at let our creative juices flow. Please group up as you see fit and create your own beautiful map of wherever you like. Bonus points for faceting in additional figures showing supplementary information. Feel free to use either conventional maps or the Google alternative. Same as yesterday, we will be walking the room to help with any issues that may arise.\n",
