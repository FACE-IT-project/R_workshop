The content for this workshop is organized into four units: __Why R?__, __Plots__, __Maps__, and __Tidy Data__. These are followed by a __Summary__ that recaps the information from the four units and provides some additional parting resources. The resources grouped into each unit may be accessed by the table of contents (TOC) on the left of this page.

During the workshop there will be a guest lecture on the creation of a __Policy Brief__. This will be followed by a two day hands-on session where attendees will break into small groups to develop a policy brief by sourcing data, cleaning it, analysing it, plotting/mapping it, and writing up a brief based on their findings.

Lastly, there are some __Bonus__ materials provided here for further exploration by the interested researchers.
