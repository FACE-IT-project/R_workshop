The content for this workshop is organized into five units: __Why R?__, __Plots__, __Maps__, __Tidy Data__, and a __Summary__. They may be accessed by the table of contents (TOC) on the left of this page. The slides and tutorials for each unit may be found there.

During the workshop there will be a guest lecture on the creation of policy briefs. This will be followed by a two day hands-on session where attendees will break into small groups to develop a policy brief by sourcing data, cleaning it, analysing it, plotting/mapping it, and writing up a brief based on their findings.

<!-- For each unit numerous slide decks, homework and lab assignments, and application exercises are provided. -->
<!-- Also provided are interactive tutorials, exams, and project assignment. -->
