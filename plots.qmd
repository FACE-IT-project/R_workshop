Though it may have started as statistical software, R has moved far beyond it's mundane origins. The language is now capable of a wide range of applications, some of which you have already seen, and some others you will see over the rest of this course. For the first half of Day 2 we are going to jump straight into data visualisation.

## Example figures

Just to whet the appetite, below is provided a small selection of the figures that R and **`ggplot2`** are capable of producing. These are things that AJ and/or myself have produced for publication or in some cases just for personal interest. Remember, just because we are learning this for work, doesn't mean we can't use it for fun, too. The idea of using R for fun may seem bizarre, but perhaps by the end of Day 5 we will have been able to convince you otherwise!

```{r example1, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The effect of variance (SD) within a temperature time series on the accurate modelling of decadal trends.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/all_plt0_no_interp_natural.png")
```

```{r example2, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The (currently) three most infamous marine heatwaves (MHWs) around the world.", out.width = "100%", fig.align = "center"}

```

## Basics of **`ggplot2`**

R comes with basic graphing capability, known colloquially (by nerds) as 'Base R'. The syntax used for this method of creating graphics is often difficult to interpret as there are few human words in the code. In addition to this issue, Base R also does not allow the user enough control over the look of the final product to satisfy the demands of many publishers. Meaning the figures tend not to look professional enough (but still much better than Excel). To solve both of these problems, and others, the **`ggplot2`** package was born. 

As part of the **`tidyverse`** (as we saw briefly on Day 1, and will go into in depth on Day 4), the **`ggplot2`** package endeavours to use a clean, easy for humans to understand syntax that relies heavily on functions that do what they say. For example, the function `geom_point()` makes points on a figure. Need a line plot? `geom_line()` is the way to go! Need both at the same time? No problem. In **`ggplot2`** we may seamlessly merge a nearly limitless number of objects together to create startlingly sophisticated figures. Before we go over the code below, it is very important to note the use of the `+` signs. When we use **`ggplot2`** code we add different lines of code to one another. Each line of code represents one new geometric or aesthetic value of the figure. It is designed this way so as to make it easier for the human eye to read through the code. 
One may see below that the code naturally indents itself if the previous line ended with a `+` sign. This is because R knows that the top line is the parent line and the indented lines are it's children. This is a concept that will come up again when we learn about tidying data. What we need to know now is that a block of code that has `+` signs, like the one below, must be run together. As long as lines of code end in `+`, R will assume that you want to keep adding lines of code. If we are not mindful of what we are doing we may tell R to do something it cannot and we will see in the console that R keeps expecting more `+` signs. If this happens, click inside the console window and push the `esc` button to cancel the chain of code you are trying to enter.

```{r basic-1, message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Load data
ChickWeight <- datasets::ChickWeight

# Create a basic figure
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick))
```

So what is that code doing? We may see from the figure that it is creating a little black dot for every data point, with the `Time` of sampling on the x axis, and the `weight` of the chicken during that time on the y axis. It then connects the dots for each chicken in the dataset. Let's break this code down line for line to get a better idea of what it is doing. The first line of code is telling R that we want to create a ggplot figure. We know this because we are using the `ggplot()` function. Inside of that function we are telling R which dataframe we want to create a figure from. Lastly, with the `aes()` argument, which is short for 'aesthetic', we tell R what the necessary parts of the figure will be. This is also known as 'mapping'. The second line of code then takes all of that information and makes points (dots) out of it. The third line takes the same information and creates lines from it. Notice in the third line that we have provided another mapping argument by telling R to group the data by `Chick`. This is how R knows to draw an individual line for each chicken, and not just one big messy jagged line. Try running this code without the group argument for `geom_line()` and see what happens.

This figure doesn't look like much yet. We saw some examples above that show how sophisticated figures may become. This is a remarkably straight forward task. But don't take my word for it, let's see for ourselves. By adding one more aesthetic to the code above we will now show each `Diet` as a different colour.

```{r basic-3}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick))
```

Do any patterns appear to emerge from the data? Perhaps there is a better way to visualise them? With linear models for example.

```{r first-lm}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

How is a linear model calculated? What patterns do we see in the data now? If you were a chicken, which feed would you want?

## To `aes()` or not to `aes()`, that is the question

The astute eye will have noticed by now that most arguments we have added to the code have been inside of the `aes()` function. So what exactly is that `aes()` function doing sitting inside of the other functions? The reason for the `aes()` function is that it controls the look of the other functions dynamically based on the variables you provide it. If we want to change the look of the plot by some static value we would do this by passing the argument for that variable to the geom of our choosing _outside_ of the `aes()` function. Let's see what this looks like by changing the colour of the dots.

```{r basic-6}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight)) +
  geom_point(colour = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick, colour = "blue"))
```

Why are the points blue, but the lines are salmon with a legend that says they are 'blue'? We may see that in the line responsible for the points (`geom_point()`) we did not put the colour argument inside of the `aes()` function, but for the lines (`geom_line()`) we did. If we know that we want some aspect of our figure to be a static value we set this value outside of the `aes()` function. If we want some aspect of our figure to reflect some part of the data in our dataframe, we must set that inside of `aes()`. Let's see an example where we set the size of the dots to equal the weight of the chicken and the thickness of the linear model lines to one static value.

```{r basic-8}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point(aes(size = weight)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", size = 1.2)
```

Notice that we have set the size of the points and the lines, but one is within `aes()` and the other not. Because the size of our points equals the weight of the chickens, the points become larger the heavier (juicier) the chickens become. But because we set the size of the lines to one static value, all of the lines are the same size and don't change because of any other variables.

## Changing labels

When we use **`ggplot2`** we have control over every minute aspect of our figures if we so wish. What we want to do next is put the legend on the bottom of our figure with a horizontal orientation and change the axis labels so that they show the units of measurement. To change the labels we will need the `labs()` function. To change the position of the legend we need the `theme()` function as it is within this function that all of the little tweaks are performed. This is best placed at the end of your block of **`ggplot2`** code.

```{r basic-4}
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Mass (g)", colour = "diet type") + # Change the labels
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") # Change the legend position
```

Notice that when we place the legend at the bottom of the figure ggplot automatically makes it horizontal for us. Why do we use 'colour' inside of `labs()` to change the legend title?


So far we have only looked at single panel figures. But as you may have guessed by now, **`ggplot2`** is capable of creating any sort of data visualisation that a human mind could conceive. This may seem like a grandiose assertion, but we'll see if we can't convince you of it by the end of this course. For now however, let's just take our understanding of the usability of **`ggplot2`** two steps further by first learning how to facet a single figure, and then stitch different types of figures together into a grid. In order to aid us in this process we will make use of an additional package, **`ggpubr`**. The purpose of this package is to provide a bevy of additional tools that researchers commonly make use of in order to produce publication quality figures. Note that `library(ggpubr)` will not work on your computer if you have not yet installed the package.

```{r facet-load}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggpubr)
```

## Faceting one figure

Faceting a single figure is built into **`ggplot2`** from the ground up and will work with virtually anything that could be passed to the `aes()` function. Here we see how to create an individual facet for each `Diet` within the `ChickWeight` dataset.

```{r facet-1, fig.cap="Simple faceted figure showing a linear model applied to each diet."}
# Load data
ChickWeight <- datasets::ChickWeight

# Create faceted figure
ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") + # Note the `+` sign here
  facet_wrap(~Diet, ncol = 2) + # This is the line that creates the facets
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Mass (g)")
```

## New figure types

Before we can create a gridded figure of several smaller figures, we need to learn how to create a few new types of figures first. The code for these different types is shown below. Some of the figure types we will learn how to use now do not work well with the full `ChickWeight` dataset. Rather we will want only the weights from the final day of collection. To filter only these data we will need to use a bit of the 'tidy' code we saw on Day 1.

```{r facet-tidy}
ChickLast <- ChickWeight %>% 
  filter(Time == 21)
```

### Line graph

```{r facet-line, fig.cap="Line graph for the progression of chicken weights (g) over time (days) based on four different diets."}
line_1 <- ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(group = Chick)) +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Mass (g)")
line_1
```

### Linear model

```{r facet-lm, fig.cap="Linear models for the progression of chicken weights (g) over time (days) based on four different diets."}
lm_1 <- ggplot(data = ChickWeight, aes(x = Time, y = weight, colour = Diet)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Mass (g)")
lm_1
```

### Histogram

```{r facet-hist, message=FALSE, fig.cap="Histogram showing final chicken weights (g) by diet."}
# Note that we are using 'ChickLast', not 'ChickWeight'
histogram_1 <- ggplot(data = ChickLast, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(fill = Diet), position = "dodge", binwidth = 100) +
  labs(x = "Final Mass (g)", y = "Count")
histogram_1
```

### Boxplot

```{r facet-box, fig.cap="Violin plot showing the distribution of final chicken weights (g) by diet."}
# Note that we are using 'ChickLast', not 'ChickWeight'
box_1 <- ggplot(data = ChickLast, aes(x = Diet, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = Diet)) +
  labs(x = "Diet", y = "Final Mass (g)")
box_1
```

## Gridding figures

With these four different figures created we may now look at how to combine them. By visualising the data in different ways they are able to tell us different parts of the same story. What do we see from the figures below that we may not have seen when looking at each figure individually?

```{r facet-grid, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.cap="All four of our figures gridded together with an automagically created common legend."}
ggarrange(line_1, lm_1, histogram_1, box_1, 
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2, # Set number of rows and columns
          labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"), # Label each figure
          common.legend = TRUE) # Create common legend
```

The above figure looks great, so let's save a copy of it as a PDF to our computer. In order to do so we will need to assign our figure to an object and then use the `ggsave()` function on that object.

```{r facet-save, eval=FALSE}
# First we must assign the code to an object name
grid_1 <- ggarrange(lm_1, histogram_1, density_1, violin_1, 
                    ncol = 2, nrow = 2, 
                    labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                    common.legend = TRUE)

# Then we save the object we created
ggsave(plot = grid_1, filename = "figures/grid_1.pdf")
```


Now that we have seen the basics of **`ggplot2`**, let's take a moment to delve further into the beauty of our figures. It may sound vain at first, but the colour palette of a figure is actually very important. This is for two main reasons. The first being that a consistent colour palette looks more professional. But most importantly it is necessary to have a good colour palette because it makes the information in our figures easier to understand. The communication of information to others is central to good science.

## R Data

Before we get going on our figures, we first need to learn more about the built in data that R has. The base R program that we all have loaded on our computers already comes with heaps of example dataframes that we may use for practice. We don't need to load our own data. Additionally, whenever we install a new package (and by now we've already installed dozens) it usually comes with several new dataframes. There are many ways to look at the data that we have available from our packages. Below we show two of the many options.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# To create a list of ALL available data
  # Not really recommended as the output is overwhelming
data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))

# To look for datasets within a single known package
  # type the name of the package followed by '::'
  # This tells R you want to look in the specified package
  # When the autocomplete bubble comes up you may scroll
  # through it with the up and down arrows
  # Look for objects that have a mini spreadsheet icon
  # These are the datasets

# Try typing the following code and see what happens...
datasets::
```

We have an amazing amount of data available to us. So the challenge is not to find a dataframe that works for us, but to just decide on one. My preferred method is to read the short descriptions of the dataframes and pick the one that sounds the funniest. But please use whatever method makes the most sense to you. One note of caution, in R there are generally two different forms of data: wide OR long. We will see in detail what this means on Day 4, and what to do about it. For now we just need to know that **`ggplot2`** works much better with long data. To look at a dataframe of interest we use the same method we would use to look up a help file for a function.

Over the years I've installed so many packages on my computer that it is difficult to chose a dataframe. The package **`boot`** has some particularly interesting dataframes with a biological focus. Please install this now to access to these data. I have decided to load the `urine` dataframe here. Note that `library(boot)` will not work on your computer if you have not installed the package yet. With these data we will now make a scatterplot with two of the variables, while changing the colour of the dots with a third variable.

```{r brew-1, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(boot)

# Load data
urine <- boot::urine

# Look at help file for more info
# ?urine

# Create a quick scatterplot
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cond))
```

And now we have a scatterplot that is showing the relationship between the osmolarity and pH of urine, with the conductivity of those urine samples shown in shades of blue. What is important to note here is that the colour scale is continuous. How can we now this by looking at the figure? Let's look at the same figure but use a discrete variable for colouring.

```{r brew-2, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(r)))
```

What is the first thing you notice about the difference in the colours? Why did we use `as.factor()` for the colour aesthetic for our points? What happens if we don't use this? Try it now.

## **`RColorBrewer`**

Central to the purpose of **`ggplot2`** is the creation of beautiful figures. For this reason there are many built in functions that we may use in order to have precise control over the colours we use, as well as additional packages that extend our options even further. The **`RColorBrewer`** package should have been installed on your computer and activated automatically when we installed and activated the **`tidyverse`**. We will use this package for its lovely colour palettes. Let's spruce up the previous continuous colour scale figure now.

```{r brew-3, warning=FALSE}
# The continuous colour scale figure
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cond)) +
  scale_colour_distiller() # Change the continuous variable colour palette
```

Does this look different? If so, how? The second page of the colour cheat sheet we included in the course material shows some different colour brewer palettes. Let's look at how to use those here.

```{r brew-4, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cond)) +
  scale_colour_distiller(palette = "Spectral")
```

Does that help us to see a pattern in the data? What do we see? Does it look like there are any significant relationships here? How would we test that?

If we want to use colour brewer with a discrete variable we use a slightly different function.

```{r brew-5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(r))) +
  scale_colour_brewer() # This is the different function
```

The default colour scale here is not helpful at all. So let's pick a better one. If we look at our cheat sheet we will see a list of different continuous and discrete colour scales. All we need to do is copy and paste one of these names into our colour brewer function with inverted commas.

```{r brew-6, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(r))) +
  scale_colour_brewer(palette = "Set1") # Here I used "Set1", but use what you like
```

## Make your own palettes

This is all well and good. But didn't we claim that this should give us complete control over our colours? So far it looks like it has just given us a few more palettes to use. And that's nice, but it's not 'infinite choices'. That is where the Internet comes to our rescue. There are many places we may go to for support in this regard. The following links, in descending order, are very useful. And fun!

- <http://tristen.ca/hcl-picker/#/hlc/6/0.95/48B4B6/345363>
- <http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/index.php>
- <http://jsfiddle.net/d6wXV/6/embedded/result/>

I find the first link the easiest to use. But the second and third links are better at generating discrete colour palettes. Take several minutes playing with the different websites and decide for yourself which one(s) you like.

## Use your own palettes

Now that we've had some time to play around with the colour generators let's look at how to use them with our figures. I've used the first web link to create a list of five colours. I then copy and pasted them into the code below, separating them with commas and placing them inside of `c()` and inverted commas. Be certain that you insert commas and inverted commas as necessary or you will get errors. Note also that we are using a new function to use our custom palette.

```{r brew-7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = cond)) +
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours = c("#A5A94D", "#6FB16F", "#45B19B",
                                    "#59A9BE", "#9699C4", "#CA86AD"))
```

If we want to use our custom colour palettes with a discrete colour scale we use a different function as seen in the code below. While we are at it, let's also see how to correct the title of the legend and its text labels. Sometimes the default output is not what we want for our final figure. Especially if we are going to be publishing it. Also note in the following code chunk that rather than using hexadecimal character strings to represent colours in our custom palette, we are simply writing in the human name for the colours we want. This will work for the continuous colour palettes above, too.

```{r brew-8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = urine, aes(x = osmo, y = ph)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = as.factor(r))) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("pink", "maroon"), # How to use custom palette
                     labels = c("no", "yes")) + # How to change the legend text
  labs(colour = "crystals") # How to change the legend title
```

So now we have seen how to control the colours palettes in our figures. I know it is a but much. Four new functions just to change some colours! That's a bummer. Don't forget that one of the main benefits of R is that all of your code is written down, annotated and saved. You don't need to remember which button to click to change the colours, you just need to remember where you saved the code that you will need. And that's pretty great in my opinion.

## DIY figures

Today we learned the basics of **`ggplot2`**, how to facet, how to brew colours, and how to plot stats. Sjog, that's a lot of stuff to remember! Which is why we will now spend the rest of Day 2 putting our new found skills to use. Please group up as you see fit to produce your very own **`ggplot2`** figures. We've not yet learned how to manipulate/tidy up our data so it may be challenging to grab any ol' dataset and make a plan with it. To that end we recommend using the `laminaria` or `ecklonia` datasets we saw on Day 1. You are of course free to use whatever dataset you would like, including your own. The goal by the end of today is to have created at least two figures (first prize for four figures) and join them together via faceting. We will be walking the room to help with any issues that may arise.
