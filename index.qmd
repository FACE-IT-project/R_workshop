This website contains all of the information and the course content for the 2022 FACE-IT School 'A **R**oundtrip From Data Handling to Data Presentation'.

The source code for this website and all of the course content is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FACE-IT-project/R_workshop).

The aim of this five-day introductory workshop is to guide you through the basics of using R via RStudio for analysis of environmental and biological data. It is ideal for people new to R or who have limited experience. This workshop is not comprehensive, but is necessarily selective. We are not hardcore statisticians, but rather ecologists who have an interest in statistics, and use R frequently. Our emphasis is thus on the steps required to analyse and visualise data in R, rather than focusing on the statistical theory.

The workshop is laid out so it begins simply and slowly to impart the basics of using R. It then gathers pace, so that by the end we are doing intermediate level analyses. Day 1 is concerned with becoming familiar with getting data into R, doing some simple descriptive statistics, data manipulation and visualisation. Day 2 takes a more in depth look at manipulating and visualising data. Day 3 focuses on creating maps. Day 4 deals with the fundamentals of reproducible research. Day 5 allows one to utilise all of the skills learned throughout the week by creating a final project. The workshop is case-study driven, using data and examples primarily from our background in the marine sciences and real life situations. There is no homework but there are in class assignments.

Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed and do not follow everything at any time during the Workshop; that is totally natural with learning a new and powerful program. Remember that you have the notes and material to go through the exercises later at your own pace; we will also be walking the room during sessions and breaks so that we can answer questions one on one. We hope that this Workshop gives you the confidence to start incorporating R into your daily workflow, and if you are already a user, we hope that it will expose you to some new ways of doing things.

Finally, bear in mind that we are self-taught when it comes to R. Our methods will work, but you will learn as you gain more experience with programming that there are many ways to get the right answer or to accomplish the same task.

You will notice that this repository uses [GitHub](https://github.com), and you are advised to set up your own repository for R scripts and all your data. We will touch on GitHub and the principles of reproducible research later, and GitHub forms a core ingredient of such a workflow.

## Venue, date and time {.unnumbered}
 
This workshop will take place from **18 November -- 28 November 2022**, **9:00--17:00**, at the Wadden Sea Station (AWI) on Sylt, Germany. The 18th and 28th are set aside for travel, with no instruction planned on these dates. Note also that the first Saturday and Sunday are half days, devoted to managing administrative non-coding work (e.g. setting up R, RStudio, and GitHub).
