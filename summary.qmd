Over the past few days we have covered quite a bit of ground. By now it is our hope that after having participated in this workshop you will feel confident enough using R to branch out on your own and begin applying what you have learned to your own research. And if you need a reminder that R can also be used for sillier things, check out the [bonus content](https://face-it-project.github.io/R_workshop/bonus.html).

Above all, remember the tidy principles you have leaned here and endeavour to apply them to all facets of your work. The more uniformly tidy your work becomes, the more compounding benefits you will begin to notice.
