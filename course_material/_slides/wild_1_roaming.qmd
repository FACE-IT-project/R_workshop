# Roaming data {background-color="#008980" style="text-align: center"}

*Robert Schlegel*

```{r tidy-3-opts, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE
)
```

## Problem

-   There are a lot of data out there, how do we access them?
-   Are there tools to help us with this?
-   What are the policies around this?

## Solution

-   We look at the **R** resources available to us
-   We go over some example implementations
-   A brief discussion on access rights is provided

## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # All-in-one
```
